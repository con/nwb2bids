nwb2bids
========

**nwb2bids** reorganizes NWB files into a BIDS directory layout.

Features:

* Automatically renames NWB files and their directories to conform to BIDS conventions.
* Extracts relevant metadata from NWB files to populate BIDS sidecar TSV & JSON files.
* Currently supports `BEP32 <https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/1705>`_ (micro-electrode electrophysiology) data types, such as extracellular (``ecephys``) and intracellular (``icephys``) electrophysiology, as well as associated behavioral events.

In the future, we plan to support:

* stimuli
* videos
* ``ndx-events``
* Hierarchical Event Descriptors (HED)
* microscopy
* ``ndx-pose`` + BIDS motion
* eye tracking
