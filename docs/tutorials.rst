Tutorial
========

This tutorial shows how to convert NWB_ files into the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS_) format using nwb2bids.

For background, see the BIDS-spec_ documentation and the NWB_ project pages.

Examples
--------

- Visit the BIDS home page: BIDS_
- Read the BIDS specification: BIDS-spec_
- Visit the NWB project page: NWB_

Notes
-----

- The lines beginning with ".. _LABEL: URL" define reusable external link targets. Refer to them by writing LABEL_ in the text (for example: BIDS_ or NWB_).
- To make these targets available across your entire Sphinx site, put them in a central include file (for example docs/_links.rst) and include that file where needed.
